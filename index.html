<h2>ðŸŽž Simulation Animations</h2>
<p>
  The following simulation animations illustrate the dynamic behavior of chromatin condensates as predicted by our model.
  These animations loop continuously to provide a seamless demonstration of the system in action.

  In addition to the above animations, the following alternative view displays a vertical arrangement.
  Here, the "25" variant is presented above the "30" variant to emphasize their differences.
